This is the codebase for my free, online Dominion server.

Notes
-----

Currently, this is the codebase as it exists locally, for dev purposes. It's a different branch on my (again, local) Subversion repository from the one I push to heroku. This is deliberate; the heroku branch has a number of grungy artefacts which I just hacked into place to Make It Work. I intend to eventually have the heroku branch up here, once I've cleaned up the grunge and worked out the minimal changes from a locally-runnable version to a heroku-runnable version.

This codebase currently runs Rails 2.3.11 and the Prototype javascript library. It's time to move on - I'll be migrating to Rails 3.1 and jQuery as the first stage in my next release (which will mainly be to implement Hinterlands). This is probably quite tricky, and so I'd advise against contributing until I've done that.
