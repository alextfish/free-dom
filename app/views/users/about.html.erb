		What is Free-Dom?
	</h1>
	<p>Free-Dom is a free-to-play server offering games of Dominion to the discerning gamer.</p>
	<h1>
		...and what's Dominion?
	</h1>
	<p>Dominion is a card game, published by <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com">Rio Grande Games</a>. Players each start with an identical personal deck of ten cards,
	and compete to gain the most points by buying additional cards for their deck. Cards bought can produce more money, allow the player to perform various actions, or
	are worth points.</p>
	<p>Rio Grande publish the rules for Dominion online, available for download as a PDF from <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278">the game's page</a>.</p>
	<h1>Which sets does Free-Dom use?</h1>
	<p>
		Free-Dom implements all cards from the base game, plus the <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=306">Intrigue</a>, 
	  <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=326">Seaside</a> and
    <a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=361">Prosperity</a> expansions. 
		<a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=356">Alchemy</a> and 
		<a href="http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=383">Cornucopia</a> are not yet supported (but they probably	will be eventually!)
	</p>  
	<h1>What do I need to play?</h1>
	<p>
		Not much. You'll need a relatively modern web-browser with Javascript enabled. FreeDom has been verified to work in recent versions of 
		<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> (v3.x, v4 and v5) and 
		<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie/home">Internet Explorer</a> (IE 8, although there's no reason it should break in IE 9).
		It's likely most other modern browsers, including mobile browsers, will also work - if you find browsers in which it works (or doesn't!) please 
		<%= link_to "let me know", contact_path %>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After that, you'll just need to <%= link_to "register", new_user_path %>, and you're good to go.
