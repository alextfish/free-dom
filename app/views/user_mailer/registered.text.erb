Hi <%= @user.name.html_safe %>,

Thanks for registering at <%= root_url.html_safe %>. Everything's gone through, so you're all set up.

To get started, visit the main page, <%= games_url.html_safe %>. See if there are any games waiting for players, or create your own game.

Whenever you're in a game, it'll update itself regularly (every minute by default). If it's a game you created then you'll be given a button to start the game as soon as at least one other player's joined the game.

Take your turn whenever you're required to, but don't worry too much about speed of play - we're a pretty relaxed site.

Finally, if you have an problems or comments, contact me on this address, or by following the instructions on the Feedback page (<%= contact_url.html_safe %>).

Oh, and Have Fun!
