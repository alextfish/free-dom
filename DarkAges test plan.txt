== INTERACTIONS: ==
Non-Supply Actions
 - Can not be gained by Haggler, Remodel
 - Can be affected by Watchtower
 - Ambassador 

Non-Supply Treasure (Spoils)
 -> Mint does not trash it
 
Piles of varying content
 - Talisman: Can only affect Ruins if the top Ruin matches the one just gained
 - Ambassador: Can return a Knight. Next player gains it. Other players don't.
 
Multiple trash triggers:
 - Using Count to simultaneously trash Fortress, Squire, Feodum, Catacombs, Sir Vander and 2xRats
 - Using Chapel to simultaneously trash Hunting Grounds, 2xCultist, Overgrown Estate with Market Square in hand
 
Graverobber - Cultist:
 - From rulebook: "For example, if a player plays Graverobber and uses it to trash a Cultist, he first draws
three cards for trashing Cultist, then continues with resolving Graverobber and gains a card costing
up to 8".

Hermit-Prince: 
 - From DominionStrategy: A Hermit that is set aside again by Prince on a turn where no cards were bought will get set aside with Prince, fail to trash itself, you gain a Madman, and the Hermit still gets to be played again by Prince next turn.

Losing Track:
 - From rulebook: Losing track of a card prevents it from being moved, but does not stop anything else from happening. For example, if you Procession a Madman, Procession first puts Madman in play; then you resolve Madman, getting +2 Actions and drawing cards and returning Madman to the Madman pile; then Procession fails to put Madman into play again, because Procession expects to find Madman in play, but it is not there, it's in the Madman pile; then you resolve Madman again, only getting +2 Actions this time, since it says "if you do" before the card-drawing, and you did not actually return it to the Madman pile this time; then Procession fails to trashMadman since Procession again expects to find Madman in play and it is not there; and then you gain an Action costing $1 if you can.
