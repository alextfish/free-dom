FreeDom/jquery
======

This is a branch of the codebase for my free, online Dominion server.

Notes
-----

Currently, "master" is the codebase as it exists on heroku.

This codebase now runs Rails 3.1, but is still using the Prototype javascript library. It's time to move on - this branch will cover migrating the JavaScript framework to jQuery.
