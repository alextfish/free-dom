FreeDom/prototype-to-jquery
=======

This is a branch of the [main codebase](https://github.com/asilano/free-dom) for my free, online Dominion server.

FreeDom is still using the Prototype javascript framework and script.aculo.us effects library. It's time to move on - this branch is for migrating to jQuery, and converting the plethora of javascript buttons etc. to UJS (as far as possible)!

_**Please, feel free to fork and contribute to this branch!**_
