FreeDom/test-improvements
=======

This is a branch of the [main codebase](https://github.com/asilano/free-dom) for my free, online Dominion server.

FreeDom's tests aren't complete. The following are definitely needed:

* **Integration tests**, to automatically test the web front-end
* **Per-card unit tests**, to test that each card does what it should. Using [Cucumber](http://cukes.info)

... and I may well be missing something else.

Note
----
_**Please fork and contribute to this branch**_ - but not the per-card tests! I don't have Cucumber set up yet, and I want to be able to drive the inital step definitions.
