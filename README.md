This is the codebase for my free, online Dominion server.

Notes
-----

Currently, "master" is the codebase as it exists on heroku.

This codebase now runs Rails 3.1, and has been migrated to use jQuery.

This codebase is now open for outside contributions in certain areas. Branches exist or will be created for:

* Implementation of Hinterlands

Additional features possibly up for implementation include:

* Structural "bug fixes" that aren't fatal, but are large. Such as occasional loss of transactional integrity
* Richer set of random-game options, a la [this randomiser](http://www.hiwiller.com/dominion/)
* Front-end restyling
* Ratings history

_**Please fork and contribute where possible!**_
